# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python Mini Project Series

- This repository contains a **Python Number Guessing Game** developed as a series of incremental mini-projects.
- Each version improves upon the previous one by adding new features, better logic, and cleaner code structure.

Goal - The goal of this project series is to strengthen Python fundamentals, practice problem-solving, and build the habit of writing readable, well-documented code while learning in public.

🚀 Project Objective : This project is part of my learning journey toward:

- Python Programming
- Data Science
- Machine Learning & AI

Instead of jumping directly into advanced topics, I am focusing on:

- Writing correct and clean Python code
- Understanding control flow and logic deeply
- Improving projects incrementally (version-wise)

🧠 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Step-by-step project evolution
- Progressive feature enhancement
- Clean folder structure and documentation
- Beginner-friendly but professionally written code
- Thoughtful use of functions, loops, and conditionals

🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook (Version 1), Python Script (Version 2)

Concepts: 

- Loops
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Exception Handling
- User Input
