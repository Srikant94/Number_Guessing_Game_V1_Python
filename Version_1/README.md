🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python) – Version 1

A beginner-friendly Number Guessing Game built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. This project is part of my hands-on practice to strengthen Python fundamentals as I progress towards Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

📌 Project Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive program where: The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 20. The user attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides hints if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number. This project is intentionally simple but serves as a foundation to practice basic Python concepts and develop logical thinking.

🛠 Concepts Practiced

Version-1 of this project helped me strengthen and apply the following Python concepts: Python variables and data types while loops for repeated execution Conditional statements (if, elif, else) Handling user input and converting data types (input(), int()) Generating random numbers using the Python random module Basic debugging and logical reasoning

▶ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the Jupyter Notebook: Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Number_Guessing_Game_Python.git

Navigate to the project folder: cd Number_Guessing_Game_Python

Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook

Open the notebook: notebooks/number_guessing_game_v1.ipynb

Run the cells to start the game and follow on-screen instructions.

📈 Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to: Understand program flow and control structures using loops Implement decision-making using conditional statements Handle user input effectively Develop problem-solving and debugging skills Gain confidence in writing and testing small Python programs

🔮 Planned Enhancements (For Version-2+)

Future improvements I plan to implement: Add an attempt limit to make the game more challenging Introduce a scoring system based on attempts Add replay functionality so users can start a new game without restarting the notebook Improve input validation to handle invalid entries These enhancements will make the game more interactive, structured, and closer to real-world application logic.

📬 Feedback

I welcome feedback and suggestions from Python enthusiasts, Data Science professionals, and recruiters as I continue to improve my skills and build more advanced projects.
