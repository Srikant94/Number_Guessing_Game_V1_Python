# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Version 1

- Version 1 is the **initial implementation** of the Number Guessing Game.
- This version focuses on building the core game logic using basic Python constructs.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this version:
- A random number is generated by the program
- The user keeps guessing until the correct number is entered
- The program provides hints if the guess is too high or too low

This version was built to practice **basic Python syntax and control flow**.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Variables and data types
- While loops
- Conditional statements (If / Elif / Else)
- User input handling
- Using the random module
- Basic debugging and logical thinking

## 🛠 Implementation Details

- The project is implemented using a **Jupyter Notebook**
- Logic is written in a simple, linear flow
- No attempt limit or scoring system is implemented in this version
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number

## ▶ How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: number_guessing_v1.ipynb
2. Run all cells
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game

## 📈 Learning Outcome

This version helped me understand:
- How loops control program flow
- How conditional logic drives decision-making
- How user input affects execution
- How to think step-by-step while coding

## 🔮 Limitations (Improved in Later Versions)

- No attempt limit
- No difficulty levels
- No scoring mechanism
- No replay option

These limitations were intentionally addressed in **Version 2**.

## ✅ Purpose of Version 1

- Version 1 represents the **foundation** of the project.
- It serves as a baseline to understand how incremental improvements can enhance both functionality and user experience.
