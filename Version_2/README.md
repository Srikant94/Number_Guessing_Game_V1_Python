# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Version 2

- Version 2 is an **enhanced and structured version** of the Number Guessing Game.
- This version introduces new features that significantly improve gameplay, usability, and code quality.

## 🚀 Enhancements Over Version 1

Version 2 introduces:

- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Dynamic number ranges based on difficulty
- Limited number of attempts per level
- Improved scoring logic
- Replay functionality
- Input validation using exception handling
- Cleaner, modular code using functions

## 🎮 Game Features

### 🔹 Difficulty Levels
| Level | Number Range | Attempts |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Easy | 1 – 10 | 7 |
| Medium | 1 – 20 | 5 |
| Hard | 1 – 30 | 3 |

### 🔹 Scoring System

- Score is calculated based on remaining attempts
- Encourages smarter guessing and strategy

### 🔹 Replay Mode

- Players can replay the game without restarting the program
- Improves overall user experience

### 🔹 Input Validation

- Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully
- Prevents program crashes due to invalid input

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Functions and modular programming
- Loops with exit conditions
- Exception handling (Try / Except)
- Code reusability and readability
- User-centric program design

## 🛠 Implementation Details

- Implemented as a Python jupyter notebook script (.ipynb)
- Functions separate concerns:
  - Difficulty selection
  - Game logic
  - Replay handling
- Code is fully commented for clarity

## ▶ How to Run

1. Open the file: number_guessing_v2.ipynb
2. Run the script in Python
3. Select a difficulty level
4. Start guessing!

## 📈 Learning Outcome

This version helped me understand:

- How to design programs with scalability in mind
- How to refactor code for better structure
- How small feature additions can greatly improve usability
- How to write professional, readable Python code
  
## ✅ Purpose of Version 2

- Version 2 demonstrates **growth in problem-solving, design thinking, and Python fundamentals**.
- It reflects a transition from “just making it work” to writing **clean and maintainable code**.
